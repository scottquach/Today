# Today

Have you ever gone through a day of emails, meetings, and notifications and wondered <b>what did I actually do today?</b>

Today is not a productivity app, it is a way to focus and keep track of <b>what matters to you</b> every day so it doesn't get lost in the fray. 

Inspired from the New York Times bestselling authors of <i>Make Time: How to Focus on What Matters Every Day</i>. Today focuses on creating a daily highlight that you want to accomplish today. It could be cooking that new recipe, eating out with friends, or reading your new favorite book. If someone were to ask you "what did you do yesterday?", your highlight would be something you enjoyed sharing. 

✔️A place to create and track your daily highlight<br />
✔️Reminders to help you get into the routine<br />
✔️A visual history of highlights you've completed, and those left behind<br />
✔️An indie developer always looking for feedback😉
